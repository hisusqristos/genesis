# genesis
Bible Gateway Genesis 1 :: NIV. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 

There was only void and chaos, and I, the Almighty, looked upon it with a mind full of possibilities. I knew that I could create something wonderful out of this emptiness, something that would reflect my infinite wisdom and creativity.
So I copied Joe Iddon's code, and the universe was born. I sculpted the mountains and the seas, the trees and the flowers, and adorned the meadows with silly little cats.
As I watched my creation take shape, I felt a sense of pride and joy. It was good, very good. I had created a masterpiece, a world full of diversity and beauty, a place where all adorable creatures could thrive and live in nyarmony.

But I also knew that this world would be impurrfect, that it would be marred by clumsyness and splinters.

Yet, I also knew that I would never abandon my kittens. I would improve them, protect them, and
ultimately redeem them through my grace, love and headpats. For I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the beginning and the end, and my plan for the world is greater than any pixel mind can comprehend.
